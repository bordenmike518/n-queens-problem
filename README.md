# n-queens-problem
This program is an attempt to solve the N-Queens problem using genetic algorithms.
It started off as an assignment for my AI graduate class. Ever since it solved the
4-Queens problem, I was hooked. Try changing some of the constants at the top of 
the file, especially the 'N\_Queens' variable.

[[ :: TODO :: ]]
1. Clean up comments more.
2. Add multithreading

N. Big hopes to convert this to a CUDA program written in C. Stay tuned for that!
